# Drinking-Water-Potability
In this app, we have predicting drinking water potability using ML models and H2O AutoML.

# Introduction
Main aim of this project is to predict the potability of water, i.e. The water is safe to drink or not Using ML and AutoML techniques.

# H2O Auto ML
It is a fully open source, distributed in-memory machine learning platform with linear scalability. H2O supports the most widely used statistical
and machine learning algorithms, including gradient boosted machines, generalised linear models, deep learning and many more.

# Project Flow

1) Data Analysis - Finding out Different relations.

2) Feature Engineering - Processing the data before it feeding to the model.

3) Model Building using ML - Using ML/Dl Algorithms.

4) Model Building using Auto ML.
